          <h1>Thank you for using web-setup</h1>
          <p>
            This is a very simple cli to setup html, css, and js with jQuery and
            Bootstrap to help coders get started easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is to just create the folders, download bootstrap and jquery
            and write a simple gulp js that can process the html, css and js at a script command.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dependencies
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bootstrap (for layout)
              </li>
              <li>
                jQuery (not used but included for convenience)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Do note that this is a very simple web project setup. You may need to use
            a more than just jQuery and Bootstrap to create a webpage.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may fork the project to customize the project based on your need.
