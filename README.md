# Front End Task
Refer to the attached Words file for the tasks.

If you are developing the site in the most basic method, you can just download the dest folder where you can find bootstrap and jQuery already attached for you perusal. Remember to also include the slick (js and css) required for one of the tasks when submitting your code.

To setup this source code (requires nodejs, npm and gulp installed globally on your machine)
1. clone this repository
2. on the terminal or command prompt at the repository folder, do a `npm install`
3. the last part is to `gulp`
4. write you code in the src folder for html, css and js. gulp will render the final version on the dest folder
